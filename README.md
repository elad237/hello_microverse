# hello_microverse
In this pull request, I was able to:
     -  Set up the linters.
     -  Create index.html file and add # Hello Microverse # to the `h1` tag.
     -  Create style.css and style the content of the `h1` tag inside it.
     -   Create `.gitignore` file and add test.md and node-modules to ignore them.
